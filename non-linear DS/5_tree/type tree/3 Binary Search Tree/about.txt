Binary Search trees possess all the properties of binary trees including some extra properties of their own,
based on some constraints, making them more efficient than binary trees.
the data in the binary Search tree is always stored in such a way that the values in the left subtree are always
less than the values in the root node and the values in the right subtree are always greater than the values in the root node.

left subtree < root node <= right subtree.
